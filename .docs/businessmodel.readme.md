Swap goods with a cash top-up (e.g., item + money for another item)


The platform solves the problem of unused assets, affordability issues, and consumer distrust in informal markets.

Middle-class & low-income earners looking for affordable alternatives.


Students & freelancers who swap gadgets, appliances, fashion, etc.
